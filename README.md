# Backend
Using MySQL in python, Jasmine has developed the wholesome concept of backend database. The code was maasive and hard to test and debug. 
After this, the main task was to create an interactive and user-friendly frontend which can be easily accesible by the users. For this, we learnt the library named Tkinter in python.
# Frontend 
Tkinter in python has been the backbone for creating all the GUIs in the frontend for our project.Manvi along with Jasmine learnt of how to create labels, title, buttons, frame, widgets, text, color and many more.
After this, the main task was to integrate both the backend and the frontend.
# Integrating backend with frontend
For this we learnt the use of OOPS.
After getting number of errors and trying different methods, we reached to the conclusion of our project.
